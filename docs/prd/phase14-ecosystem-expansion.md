- As a developer, I need development tools so that I can:
  - Debug table state with browser extensions
  - Profile performance to identify bottlenecks
  - Visualize plugin dependencies and interactions
  - Test accessibility during development
  - Generate configuration from existing data

### **2.7 Community Resources**

- As a community member, I need resources so that I can:
  - Ask questions and get answers from experts
