I need to see the previous code to properly apply these changes. The suggested code appears to be a **template for starting NEW tasks**, but without seeing what's currently in the context file, I cannot safely merge it.

Could you please share the current content of the context file? This will help me:

1. Preserve any important existing context
2. Properly merge the new template structure
3. Ensure no information is lost

Alternatively, if you want to:

- **Reset to a fresh template**: I can confirm this is ready to use as-is
- **Keep existing content**: Please share the current file first

Which would you prefer?
