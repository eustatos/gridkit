## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS MADE

**Add decisions as you make them:**

- ✅ Decision: Separate factory, instance, and builder concerns for better modularity
- ✅ Decision: Use dependency injection pattern for better testability
- ✅ Decision: Implement lazy evaluation for performance optimization
- ✅ Decision: Optimize EventBus by avoiding unnecessary sorting when all handlers have same priority
- ✅ Decision: Remove undefined memory measurement functions to make code work
- ✅ Decision: Add proper imports to fix undefined function references
- ✅ Decision: Add export keywords to make functions available externally
- ✅ Decision: Create missing row module to satisfy dependencies
- ✅ Decision: Fix event middleware imports to use existing modules
- ✅ Decision: Create missing ValidationAggregateError class to satisfy instanceof checks
- ✅ Decision: Add export keywords to make validateAndNormalize function available externally
- ✅ Decision: Add export keywords to make normalization functions available externally
- ✅ Decision: Update tests to check error types instead of specific messages
- ✅ Decision: Fix import of createStateStore function to use existing createStore

## 📝 SESSION NOTES

**Insights:**

- The factory function needs to be the single entry point with comprehensive validation
- Performance monitoring is critical for large datasets
- Memory safety is non-negotiable - must implement proper cleanup
- EventBus optimization: Avoid sorting handlers when all have the same priority
- Undefined function references can break the entire module
- Proper imports are essential for module functionality
- Export keywords are necessary for function availability
- Missing modules need to be created to satisfy dependencies
- Event middleware imports must use existing modules
- Missing error classes must be created to satisfy instanceof checks
- Export keywords are critical for function availability
- Test validation should check error types, not specific messages
- Function imports must match actual function names

**Lessons:**

- Validation should be isolated for better error reporting
- Separate validation from normalization for clarity
- Error handling with context is essential for developer experience
- Performance optimizations should be targeted and measured
- Always ensure all referenced functions are defined and properly imported
- Module structure should follow clear import/export patterns
- Export keywords are critical for function availability
- Missing dependencies must be created to satisfy module requirements
- Event system dependencies must be properly resolved
- Error class dependencies must be properly resolved
- Function exports must be properly defined
- Test validation should be robust and check error types
- Function imports must match actual function names
